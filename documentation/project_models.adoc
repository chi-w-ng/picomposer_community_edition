== Project, Models and Templates

PIComposer manages models and instance templates in a project. Each project has its own document database where model metadata and private instance templates are stored. 

[NOTE]
====
Templates within a project are available to all its models.  
====

Users navigate to the project pane from the workspace by either double clicking on an item in project listing or by clicking the project button image:navigationbar-project-button.png[] to navigate to the selected project.  

The project pane has two tabs: model and template.  To work with models, activate the model tab.

=== Working with Models

To add a model, click the image:navigationbar-add-button.png[] button on the navigation bar. This command routes the user to the model creation page.  

.Model creation page

To delete a model, select it in the model list, and click the minus image:navigationbar-minus-button.png[] button.

=== Spatial Template

The EXPRESS models are extremely powerful and versatile. Unfortunately, to achieve such versatility, it is extremely verbose.  To name just a few instance types that must be included in a bare minuminum valid BIM model:

* Header objects
* IfcProject
* IfcGeometricRepresentationContext
* IfcUnitAssignment
* multiple instances of IfcUnit
* IfcApplication
* IfcPerson
* IfcOrganization
* IfcPersonAndOrganization
* ...

PIComposer uses spatial templates definition to scaffold a model. A static spatial template is a json file specifying the initial model spatial heiarchy. A example spatial template is listed below:  

[source,javascript]
----
{
	"schema": "ifc4x3",
	"element": {
		"type": "ifcproject",
		"name": "from_template",
		"children": [
			{
				"type": "ifcsite",
				"name": "bluff",
				"location": [
					0.0,
					0.0,
					0.0
				],
				"children": [
					{
						"type": "ifcbuilding",
						"name": "East Wing",
						"location": [
							0.0,
							0.0,
							0.0
						],
						"children": [
							{
							  "type": "ifcbuildingstorey",
								"name": "first floor",
								"tag" : "floor.1",
								"location": [
									0.0,
									0.0,
									0.0
								]
							},
							{
							  "type": "ifcbuildingstorey",
								"name": "second floor",
								"tag" : "floor.2",
								"location": [
									0.0,
									0.0,
									2300.0
								]
							}
						]
					}
				]
			}
		]
	}
}
----

The json object in the spatial template defines a recursive structure.  

To understand the json structure, it might be easier to look at the simplified corresponding dart object that the json object is deserialized to.

[source,dart]
----
class SpatialElement {
  String? icon;
  String? schema;
  Element element;
  SpatialElement({
    this.icon,
    this.schema = 'ifc4x3',
    required this.element,
  });
}

class Element {
  String type;
  String? name;
  String? tag;
  String? description;
  String? relType;
  int? count;
  List<double>? location;
  List<double>? axis;
  List<double>? refDirection;
  List<Element>? children;
  Element({
    required this.type,
    this.name,
    this.tag,
    this.description,
    this.relType,
    this.count,
    this.location,
    this.axis,
    this.refDirection,
    this.children,
  });
}
----
A spatial template is first deserialized into a SpatialElement object.  For PIComposer to create a model from this template, the SpatialElement object must have:

* Schema--the schema name of the model, must be ifc4x3
* Element--the root instance in the spatial heiarchy, must be IfcProject type

Each Element object defines a IfcSpatialStructuralElement.

Starting from the root IfcProject element, the rest of the spatial structure is defined recursively; IfcProject element have "children", which in turn might have its own children, etc.

For each object of type Element we have:

* Type -- concrete subtype of IfcSpatialStructureElement, for example, IfcBuilding
* Name -- name of the instance, optional
* Tag -- enable search by tag, optional
* Description -- description, optional
* Reltype -- relationship type to parent, defalut to  IfcRelAggregates, optional
* Count--number of instance to create, default to 1, optional
* Location--object placement location, optional
* Axis--object placement axis, optional
* RefDirection--object placement refDirection, optional
* Children--decendants, optional

[TIP]
====
use the "location" coordinates to set story elevation, like it is done on second floor of the example
====

When executing a spatial template, PIComposer creates the IfcProject, the necessary headers, contextual objects, and the model's unit system. PIComposer creates two parallel heiarchy or trees:

* The spatial tree that defines the logical containment/parent and children relationship
* placement tree.  Child placment is always relative to its containing parent.

[NOTE]
====
Spatial template released with PIComposer are placed in the installation subfolder:  icon:folder[] picomposer_data/spatial_template/.  They are good source of example.

User defined spatial template should be placed in: icon:folder[]Users/yourusername/.picomposer_community/picomposer_data/spatial_template/

All spatial templates in spatial_template folders appear in the template list in the model creation page, including user defined ones.
====

[TIP]
====
Spatial template could also be procedural, a dart or C++ creational script.  The sample template appearing in the template list is such example.
====

=== Working with Instance Template

To access the instance template listing, activate the template tab on the project pane.

.Project pane, template tab
image::project-template-tab.png[]

Instance templates are the core unit of reuse in PIComposer models.  They are the equivalence to CATIA's Power Copy.  Only they are simpler, much easier to create and in many aspects, more flexible and powerful. Moreover, they could be shared and available to all users. 

They are easy to create--they are derived from the basic building blocks of a model a user already created. 

They are customizable--they add dynamic behavior to a static element and model, allowing users to manipulate only the essentail property of an component.  

They are extensible--they could be associated with a script written in dart or C++ and transform simple component into highly complex ones.

They could be a pure component creational procedure in dart or C++.

==== Simple Instance Template

Any instance of type IfcShapeRepresentation and IfcProduct subtype in PIComposer could be extracted as a simple template.  A template groups a set of entity instances into package and reuse in a compatible context. Some template may contain complex spatial heiearchy.  For exmaple, an IfcWall template may contain openings and doors/windows. A private template is stored in the project store and is available to all models in a project. 

An instance template is created from any above mentioned instance via the create template command, see  <<Instance Root Node>> for detail. 

.create template
image::root_node_create_template_command.png[]

==== Parametric Template

A parametric template is a simple template with internal attributes exposed to user manipulation allowing for dynamic transform of a simple template. These parametric attributes are specified by a json file. 

Multiple json files are possible for a given simple template.  Each parametric template must have a unique identitier.  See the <<Viewing and Editing Instance Template>> section for details.

[TIP]
====
There is a "generated id" command on the root node of a private template to generate unique identifier.  This command must be turned on in the preference if you wish to use the command.
====

We explain the parametric template's structure by examining the example.

Below is parametric template of a circular extrude where we expose the depth and radius to user input: 

[source,javascript]
----
{
	"is_procedural": false,
	"interactive": true,
	"template_id": "QK4heQ6jS-ikgAnbBYxEyg",
	"transform_id": "YTtBFTBCSViKoVBsqEhs1w",
	"description": "cylindrical extrude transform",
	"attributes": [
		{
			"value" : {
				"name": "depth",
				"fun_type": "REAL",
				"value": null,
				"type": "RealValue"
			},
			"path":{"type":1,"nodes":[[6,0,0,[8,2495730769]],[1,0,2],[2,0,[7,1494207214]]],"index":[3,null,null,null]}
		},
		{
			"value" : {
				"name": "radius",
				"fun_type": "REAL",
				"value": null,
				"type": "RealValue"
			},
			"path": {"type":1,"nodes":[[6,0,0,[8,2495730769]],[1,0,2],[2,0,[7,1494207214]],[2,0,[5,1936262883]]],"index":[3,null,null,null]}
		}
	],
	"defaults": []
}
----

* is_procedural--always false for a parametric template, no associated procedure.
* interactive--should mostly be true, unless the template expect no user input. 
* template_id--the unique identifier of the template we wish to parematrize.
* transform_id--the parametric template identifier.
* description--the description of the parametric template.  This appears on the template listing.
* attributes--the set of parameters for the template.  
** value:
*** name--the name of the parameter, this will appear in the interactive dialog.
*** fun_type--the possible types are: REAL, INT64, BOOLEAN
*** value--the exchanged value of this attribute
*** type--the type could be: RealValue, IntValue, BoolValue
** path--the path location of the attribute.  See the <<Viewing and Editing Instance Template>> section on how to obtain this value.
* defaults--default values for the attributes, used to populate the interactive dialog.

Below is the dialog when user creates an instance using the template.

.cylindrical extrude transform
image::parametric_template_instantiation.png[]

[TIP]
====
PIComposer places paremetric json configuration files in the installation folder icon:folder[] /picomposer_data/template_transform/template_id/

User defined template must be placed in the folder icon:folder[] Users/yourusername/.picomposer_community/picomposer_data/template_transform/template_id/
====

==== Template Transformation and Procedural Instance

A template transformation is a parametric template associated with a procedure written either in dart or C++.  

Procedural Instance is a dart or C++ script that interacts with and updates the model directly.

PIComposer releases many examples of template transformations and procedure instances.

[NOTE]
====
Tooling for creating template transform and procedure instance is not available in PIComposer Community edition. 
====

An instance template is visible to all models in the project and is considered private to the project.

A shared template is a simple template published to the PIComposer Cloud Service and is avaialable to all users. 

A user uses a shared template by downloading it into a project's private template collection. 

All templates have a unique identifier for life time management and tracking.  Only the shared template author is allowed to remove or update a shared template.  A shared template modification is done by re-uploading a private copy.

[NOTE]
====
PIComposer releases many shared templates. 
====

Shared template summary:

* Shared templates are immutable
* Updated by the republication a private copy 
* Update privileges are limited to the owner of the shared template

Since templates are stored in databases, in the cloud or locally on a device, they must be retrieved using database query.  PIComposer exposes these query as filters.

To browse the shared library, click the image:project-template-share-button.png[] shared radio button and use the type or tag filter.  

[NOTE]
====
When the template tab is activated, PIComposer loads a list of template types, setting it up for the type filter. 
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When a user clicks the shared button, the list of types is retrieved from the cloud, users will experience some latancy.
====

==== Type Filter

Filters plays an essential role in accessing and using PIComposer's data content.  There are type filters for both entity instances in a model and templates in a project. 

.Type filter
image::project-template-type-filter.png[]

All type filters function the same way.

To use the type filter, first select the type:

. Select a type from the dropdown list
. Select *custom type* text field, and manually key in the type.
. To list all, type the word *all* in the custom text field

Then click on the image:project-template-type-filter-button.png[] type filter button.

[NOTE]
====
Type filter on the shared template library is executed on the cloud.
====

==== Tag Filter

For search and retrieval purpose, both entity instance and template can be tagged at creation time.  Tags are indexed in document stores.  A shared template has the same tag as the private copy.

.Tag filter
image::project-template-tag-filter.png[]

To apply the tag filter, enter the tag in the textfield and click the image:project-template-tag-filter-button.png[] tag filter button.

==== Viewing and Editing Instance Template

To interact with a template, select it on the template list.  All commands related to the loaded template is availiable on the root node of the tree.  

.Private template command menu
image:project-template-ifcproduct-command.png[] image:project-template-ifcshaperepresentation-command.png[]

* show 3d--launch browser and show template in 3d viewer
* share--publish private template to PIComposer communal cloud
* add shape--add a IfcRepresentationShape to the IfcProduct
* add representation item--add a representation item to a IfcRepresenationShape
* delete--remove the template from project
* copy select path--copy the path of the selected node to clipboard, helpful for creating parametric template
* copy template id--copy the current template id to clipboard
* generate id--generate a UUID and copy it to clipboard

[NOTE]
====
A template is special kind of instance, it is manipulate like other instances in a model when it comes to its attributes.  Each attribute of a private template are mutable like those of an entity instance in a model. For detail on working with instances, see <<Working with Instance Detail Tree>>.
====

Shared templates, private parametric templates, transformation templates and procedure entitys are immutable.
