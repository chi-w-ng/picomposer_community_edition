== PIComposer BIM Model and Entity Instance

A PIComposer model is a collection of entity instances, some of which can be grouped as a collection of related instances, forming a mini-model with an implicit context. Each BIM model in PIComposer has its own database, and each instance is persisted as a document.

In PIComposer, there are two essential organizational concepts that are emphasized for each model: spatial structure and object placement. The spatial structure enriches a BIM model with a logical organizational structure, while object placement defines the physical location of an instance within the model. These concepts are presented as trees in PIComposer.

The spatial tree and the placement tree are managed in parallel, meaning that creating a node in the spatial tree will trigger the corresponding creation of a node in the placement tree.

It's important to note that the structure of the placement tree is immutable, its structure is by product of the spatial tree structure.

[NOTE]
====
Placement tree display could be turned of by preference
====

Each instance in the model is visualized as a tree (sometimes you may encounter an acyclic graph) called the instance detail tree. In this tree, each tree node represents either a logical grouping of instances or an attributed node of an instance. The instance detail tree is responsible for managing all additions, modifications, and deletions of instance attributes.

Several components of an instance can be displayed on the instance detail tree, including:

. propertyset/quantityset
. object placement
. placement absolute coordinate
. typeproduct
. shapes

[TIP]
====
Each component type display in the detail tree could be turned on/off using user preference.
====

PIComposer Community Edition is a single document application. To load a model, select a model in the Project pane model listing and click the image:navigationbar-model-button.png[] model button or simply double click on the item on the model list.

.Model pane, spatial tree
image::model-spatial-tab.png[]

[NOTE]
====
User can return to the last active model by clicking the image:navigationbar-model-button.png[] model button from any other page of PIComposer.
====

PIComposer splits model presentation into two areas:

* the model structure
* model instance detail

The model structure area comprises of three tabs

* spatial--displays the logical spatial tree
* placement--displays the phyical placement tree
* filters--random instance access using filter and searches, also free form instance creation

=== Selection Set

A selection set is an essential component of the PIComposer user interface. Each of the three model panel tabs—spatial, placement, and filter—has its own selection set. Many commands in PIComposer are executed in the context of the current selection set. It allows users to create inter-node links, insert templates into the spatial tree, insert selected nodes into other nodes, and perform various other actions.

=== Working with the Spatial Tree

The spatial tree is where the model spatial structure is managed. The commands to manipulate the tree are directly available on the tree node as popup menu items. To see the context-sensitive commands on a tree node, simply right-click on it.

.typical spatial command
image::model-spatial-node-command.png[]

[NOTE]
====
All tree commands are context-sensitive, i.e. their availability and actions depend on the node type and the content of the node.
====

The commands available to the spatial tree nodes are:

* add child--add a IfcSpatialStructural element or IfcProduct to the spatial structure.
* add template child--instantiate the selected IfcProduct template in the filter tab to the spatial structure. 
* delete child--delete the select node
* show propertyset--show the current node's propertyset/quantityset in the instance detail tab.
* show shape--show the IfcShapeRepresentation of the node
* show typed--show the IfcTypeProduct of the node in the detail tab.
* copy--copy the current to clipboard
* paste--paste the clipboard content as child.

[NOTE]
====
Only leaf nodes can be deleted, except nodes where their children are logically part of the node's content, such as a wall with child openings or fills.
====

==== Add Child

To add a child to the spatial tree, select the parent node, right click on it to activate the node menu, and select the image:model-add-child-menu-item.png[] add child menu item.  This command creates three sets of information:

* the IfcProduct instance
* the shape component and the material for the shape
* local object placement component

.product creation dialog.
image::model-add-product-dialog.png[]
The options on the product tab include:

. To specify the IfcProduct type, type it in the custom text box or select it from the dropdown.
. To specify the relation of the product to the parent object, select the IfcRelRelation type from the dropdown or leave it at auto to automatically select it.
. Tag the instance for search.

.prodcut creation dialog IfcProductRepresentation tab
image::model-add-product-shape-dialog.png[]
The shape tab adds a IfcShapeRepresentation to the product.  The options are:

. create shape via a template
. create 3 dimensional shape
. create 2 dimensional shape
. create 1 or 0 dimensional shape
. create IfcStyledItem for the shape

Fill in the necessary information on each tab and click OK when done.

[TIP]
====
If you wish to skip adding IfcShapeRepresentation, leave the type dropdown to 'null'.   
====

[NOTE]
====
If a template is not used when creating IfcShapeRepresenation, only a skeleton of a IfcRepresentationItem is created.  Details must be fill out in the *Instance Detail Tree*.    
====

[NOTE]
====
Adding children using the spatial tree node menu always adds a corresponding placement node to the placement tree. The child is placed relative to the parent.
====

[NOTE]
====
Adding a child using tree node menu commands creates the desired child, as well as other related nodes such as a child's placement node, and additionally, multiple inverse links in the database to manage the various relationships between the nodes in different trees. To ensure that the correct model content appears in the trees, it is best to use the available commands.
====

==== Add Template As Child

This command uses the filter selection set. To instantiate an IfcProduct template as a child of a spatial node, follow these steps:

. activate the template tab
. check the template radio button
. use the type or tag filter to find the desired template, see the section <<Working with Instance Template>>.
. select the template

To add a template as child to the spatial structure, select the parent node, right click on it to activate the node menu, and select the image:model-add-child-template-menu-item.png[] add child template menu item. Enter the necessary information in the template creation dialog if the template is interactive.

==== Other Spatial Tree Node Commands

The delete child command image:model-delete-child-menu-item.png[] deletes the selected node and the corresponding placement node in the placement.  If the inverse link count to the shared IfcShapeRepresentation is 0, the IfcShapeRepresentation will be deleted from the model.

The copy command image:model-copy-child-menu-item.png[] copies the node to clipboard.  Only leaf node can be copy.  

[TIP]
====
Copy command exception: nodes that could be templates are copyable.  For exmple an IfcWall with openings and doors/windows are copyable although it has openings as children 
====

The paste command image:model-paste-child-menu-item.png[] pastes the content of the clip to the tree.

[TIP]
====
Unlike template packaging, which do not package IfcTypeProduct, IfcPropertyset components into the template, the copy/paste command copy does since we are pasted into same model context. 
====

The show type command image:model-goto-typeproduct-menu-item.png[] shows the IfcTypeProduct componet of an entity in the detail tree.  

[NOTE]
====
All the 'show' commands, such as 'show shape', apply the instance ID filter to the targeted component to display the component in the detail tree.
====

=== Working with the Placement Tree

To highlight its importance in the BIM model, PIComposer user interface includes the placement tree.

To access the placement tree, simply activate the placement tab.

.The placement tree
image::model-placement-tab.png[]

TThe placement tree structure is immutable, meaning its structure is created during the creation of the spatial tree. When a spatial node corresponding to a placement is deleted, the placement will be automatically deleted as well.

The only available command for the placement tree is image:model-add-goto-placed-instance-menu-item.png[], which navigates to the placed instance associated with the IfcLocalPlacement.

While the placement tree itself is immutable, the placement node is mutable. Like all instances, its attributes can be modified using the instance detail tree.

[NOTE]
====
The 'show placed instance' command uses an inverse link to find the placed product instance in the model, selects it in the instance filter, and then shows its content in the detail tree.
====

[TIP]
====
The placement tree can be hidden/shown by setting the hide flag in user preference.
====

=== Working with Filters

Filters allow users to quickly search and retrieve items within the model or project. The filter tab serves as the workbench for dealing with free form instances and working with instances outside of the spatial structure framework. There are two types of filters in the model pane: instance filters and template filters.

For details about template filters, refer to the section on <<Working with Instance Template>>. In the following section, we will focus on instance filters.

.Instance Filter
image::model-instance-filter.png[]

==== Instance Type Filter

The basic functionality of the instance type filter is similar to the template <<Type Filter>>. However, the instance filter has two additional features:

* Filter by subtypes: The subtype filter operates in the same way as the <<Type Filter>>, but it considers all subtypes of the user-specified type.
* Create entity instance of the filter type: The instance filter allows users to directly create an entity instance of the selected filter type.

[TIP]
====
The user input type could be abstract for the subtype filter.  
====

[NOTE]
====
Instance type filter is limited to return 1000 result instances.
====

==== Instance Creation  

To create instance of the desired type, select the type from the dropdown list and click the create image:model-instance-filter-add-entity.png[] button.

[TIP]
====
To create an instance of type not on the dropdown list, enter the type using the 'custom type' text box.  The type user wants to create must not be abstract.

.type filter dropdown
image::instance_type_filter_create.png[]
====

[WARNING]
====
Instances created using the 'create' command via the filter panel will not create any inverse links, unlike when using the spatial tree commands. Users are responsible for managing instance lifecycle and data consistency.  
====


[NOTE]
====
The instance tag filter functions exactly like the tempate tag filter, see <<Tag Filter>>.
====

==== Instance Id Filter
Instance type filter is based on a list of specific instance id laterals and a list of ranges.  

.Instance id Filter
image::model-instance-filter-instance-id-example.png[]

To use the id filter, first enter the search string in the instance id text box.  The syntax is a comma separated list of positive integers and a list of integer ranges. A range is a pair of positive integer separated by a dash.  

In the example above, we are looking in the ranges 90 to 100, 200 to 210 and the instance ids 2, 45, 10 and 15.

Next click image:model-instance-filter-instance-id.png[] the instance id filter button.

[NOTE]
====
Each range is limited to 1000.
====

=== Working with Instance Detail Tree

The STEP ISO-10303 standard is a group of standards including an object model specification using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPRESS_(data_modeling_language)[EXPRESS language].  

An object is a collection of attributes. In PIComposer, a representation of an object is referred to as an instance—an instantiation of an entity type.

==== Instance Detail Tree

According to ISO-10303-11, "EXPRESS data types are classified according to their nature as: simple data types, aggregation data types, constructed data types, named data types, and generalized data types."

The instance detail tree is where PIComposer users interact with instances and their attributes, which are referred to as "entity data types."

.Instance detail tree
image::model-instance-detail.png[]

The instance detail tree is a federated view that displays the instance along with its components. The visibility of components is optional and can be controlled by user preference. The optional nodes in the instance detail tree include:

* placement
** absolute coordinates
* type--IfcTypeProduct
* propertyset/quantityset
* shape--IfcShapeRepresentation

[TIP]
====
The image:model-instance-show-detail-topple.png[] optional attribute filter, part of SchemaSense system (see <<SchemaSense and working with Attributes>> below),  hides optional attribute of an instance. This filter is also part of user preference
====

Like the spatial tree, user modify tree content by operating directly on the tree nodes.  

==== Instance Root Node

Operations that directly affect the basic structure of the node or entity's components are anchored at the root node. The operations on the root node include:

* show 3d--show the instance in 3d. Available if a instance has shape  
* add to layer--add instance to a layer, available if there is layer in the model and the instance is of type IfcShapeRepresentation
* clear layer--remove instance from all layer it is assigned to
* create template--create a private template from the instance.  
* add shape--add a IfcShapeRepresentation component to instance
* clear shape--remove all shape.  Also, if the reference count of any shape reach zero, it will be removed from model
* Add RepItem--add a IfcRepresenationItem to a IfcShapeRepresentation component.
* add shape to selected--add selected IfcShapeRepresentation instance to the spatial tree selected node. 
* add type to selected--add IfcTypeProduct subtype to the selected spatial tree node. The current instance is the selected IfcRelDefinedByType component in the instance filter.
* add type--add IfcTyedProduct to instance
* remove type--remove instance from IfcRelDefinedByType component
* add pset--add IfcRelDefinedByProperties to instance
* clear pset--remove all IfcRelDefinedByProperties from instance
* add pset to selected--add filter selected IfcRelDefinedByProperties component to the spatial selected node.
* add template shape to selected--add template shape to the spatial selected node.
* delete--remove the instance

.Typical IfcProduct root node menu items
image::model-instance-detail-root-node-commands.png[]

==== SchemaSense and working with Attributes

An instance is a collection of attributes.  Each attribute has a data type. The basic attribute data types are:

* number
* real
* integer
* string
* boolean
* logical
* binary
* aggregation--collection
* defined type
* entity
* enum
* select

[TIP]
====
A defined type is an alias for some already existing underlying type. For example, IfcLogical is a LOGICAL type.
====

SchemaSense is PIComposer's context-aware schema guidance and informational system that speeds up instance creation and editing. It consists of three functional components:

* Filtering of optional attributes: The optional attribute filter image:model-instance-show-detail-topple.png[] hides the optional attributes of an instance. This allows users to create a valid instance while omitting optional attributes.

* Attribute description during mouse hover: When hovering over a tree node, SchemaSense displays the EXPRESS type of the node in the form of a tooltip. If an attribute is null, SchemaSense indicates this to the user.

* Context-aware schema-based tree node attribute menu: SchemaSense provides a context-aware menu for modifying or adding attributes. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex attribute types (see below) such as entities, collections, selects, and enums. SchemaSense provides dropdown lists or menu items for modifying or adding values to nodes, allowing users to create multiple values for collections, select entity types or enums. It ensures a sensible workflow when creating select attribute types and helps prevent instances with syntactical errors.

PIComposer categorizes attributes into two groups: 

* simple attributes, which consist of single values and require only a single node for user interaction,
* complex attributes, which consist of multiple values and require a subtree to store their values.

==== Simple Attributes
The simple type include:

* number
* real
* integer
* string
* boolean
* logical
* binary
* defined type, with simple underlining type
* enum

Numeric types, string and binary are stored in a text box.  Boolean, logical, and enums are presented in a dropdown list. In all cases, user interaction is straight forward.

.typcal attribute node command
image::model-simple-attribute-commands.png[]

[TIP]
====
When an attribute has been modified, there are two ways to commit the updates to the data store in PIComposer. You can either right-click on the label of the attribute to access the tree node menu and select the 'save' menu item, or click the 'save' button located at the top-right corner of the detail instance tree interface.    
====

[TIP]
====
The 'save' button located in the upper right corner of the interface is a batch save button. It allows you to commit all changes made to the detail instance tree to the data store all at once. The attribute node save command is a targeted command; it will only save its change and clear changes to other nodes.
====

The defined type IfcGloballyUniqueId uses string as its underlying type. Since users may not have access to a UUID generator, PIComposer provides the 'set guid' command. To set a guid attribute, right-click on the label of the attribute and select the 'set guid' command image:model-instance-detail-set-guid.png[].

==== Complex Attributes
The complex attribute types are:

* entity  
* select
* collection

A complex attribute typically requires multiple nodes to represent its value. In particular, when an entity instance is composed in situ, it will occupy a full subtree.

[[node_commands]]Attribute node commands include:

* create--create an entity instance in place
* set reference--set attribute value as entity instance reference
* set reference selected--set spatial tree entity instance attriubte value to reference the selected instance in instance filter. 
* remove--remove instance or instance reference from a instance collection attribute
* show instance--show attribute instance in detail using instance filter.
* nullify--set optional attriubte to null

.typical entity attribute command
image::model-instance-detail-entity-attribute-commands.png[]

Just as there are two ways--link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20object%20composition,and%20aggregation%20is%20often%20ignored.[aggregation and composition]--to associate one object to another, there are two ways to associate an entity attribute to an entity instance.

==== A Brief Introduction to Object modeling
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, a PIComposer model is a collection of objects.  This section introduces some object concepts useful in the use of PIComposer.

.According to ChatGTP of OpenAI:
====
Objects and Object Association

In object-oriented programming, *objects* are the fundamental building blocks that represent entities in the real world or abstract concepts. They are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. *Object association* is the concept of connecting objects together to represent relationships between them. 

Object association can be implemented using two approaches: composition and aggregation. Both approaches are used to represent different types of relationships between objects.

Object Composition

Object composition is a form of object association where one object contains another object as a part of its state. The contained object cannot exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is tied to the container object. This is known as a "has-a" relationship.

For example, a car object may contain an engine object. The engine is a part of the car and cannot exist without it. The car object controls the lifecycle of the engine object, and the engine object cannot exist outside of the car object.

Object Aggregation

Object aggregation is a form of object association where one object uses another object as a part of its functionality. The contained object can exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is not tied to the container object. This is known as a "uses-a" relationship.

For example, a car object may use a navigation system object to provide directions to the driver. The navigation system is not a part of the car, and it can exist independently of the car object. The car object does not control the lifecycle of the navigation system object, and the navigation system object can exist outside of the car object.

Difference between Object Composition and Object Aggregation

The key difference between object composition and object aggregation is the lifecycle of the contained object. In object composition, the contained object cannot exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is tied to the container object. In object aggregation, the contained object can exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is not tied to the container object.

Another difference is the relationship between the container object and the contained object. In object composition, the contained object is a part of the container object, and it is owned by the container object. In object aggregation, the contained object is used by the container object, and it is not owned by the container object.

Conclusion

Object association is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming that allows developers to model relationships between objects. Object composition and object aggregation are two approaches used to represent different types of relationships between objects. It is important to understand the difference between these two approaches to choose the appropriate approach for a given situation.
====

==== Object Aggregation and Composition in PIComposer

Aggregation is the default instance-to-instance association in the STEP standard, and it is the only option in the ISO 10303 Part 21 standard. The most important difference between object composition and aggregation is that an aggregated object is potentially shared among many objects, while a composed object is embedded in the parent object.

.Anatomy of Aggregation and Composer
image::model-object-aggregation-composition.png[]
In the figure above:

. The composite node groups all the shared children within a container object to be referenced.
. The IfcCartesianPoint object is an aggregated object referenced by 7 inside the composed IfcPolyloop object.
. The composed IfcClosedShell inside an IfcFacetedBrep object.
. The cfsfaces attribute of the IfcClosedShell object contains a composed collection of IfcFaces.
. Composed IfcFaces.
. The polygon attribute of IfcPolyloop, which comprises a collection of aggregated IfcCartesianPoint.
. An aggregated IfcCartesianPoint.
. The contextofitems attribute of an IfcShapeRepresentation object. It references an IfcGeometricRepresentationContext object in the model.

[NOTE]
====
* To share an object within a model, create it in the model using the filter panel and share it by aggregation.
* To share an object within a container object, create it under the composites node and share it by aggregation.
* To compose an object, use a create/add object command and compose the object in situ. For details, see below.
* Prefer composition over aggregation whenever possible.
* To share across model boundaries, create a template.
====

One way to create an aggregation is use the *reference selected instance* command.
To use the *reference selected instance* command, follow the steps below:

. select the desired reference target in instance filter
. right click on the entity attribute node label to activate popup menu
. choose image:model-set-reference-selected-command.png[] set reference selected menu item

[TIP]
====
"Reference selected" command will only be available if the selected instance is compatible to the Entity attribute. If attribute is optional, it must be null. To reset to a different reference, nullify first
====

To set reference without using instance filter, select the image:model-set-reference-command.png[] set reference menu item and enter the target instance id on the dialog.

.set reference
image::model-set-reference-dialog.png[]

For a component, as a rule for non-shared attribute instance, the create command is the prefered method when populating entity attribute values. In the case of shared instance in a component, use the add composite command to create the shared instance, see <<Component and Composite>>.

To create attribute instance in place, right click on the attribute label, then select image:model-instance-detail-create-attribute-instance-command.png[] command.  If necessary fill in the detail in object creation dialog.

[NOTE]
====
If the type to create has no subtype, the attribute instance is directly created without soliciting input from the user. 
====

==== Working With Select

A select entity attribute is a single value polymorphic container; it could hold value of any defined type within its specification.  

There are three commands for select attributes:

* nullify--set optional select attribute to null value
* create--create the select object in place.
* remove--remove select from a collection of select

.select attriubte menu
image::model-select-attribute-menu.png[]

The PIComposer create select user interface is based on two key concepts:

* the selected type
* the value of the selected type

To create a select attribute value, select the image:model-create-select-attribute-menu-item.png[] create select menu item.  Fill in the detail in the create select dialog by first specifying the selected type, then value type.

.example of select of a select attribute
image::model-select-create-dialog.png[]

==== Working with Collection

STEP aggregation data types are collections of defined types. Aggregations could contain order or unordered, unique or none-unique values.  Aggregation containers include:

* array--indexed ordered collection
* list--ordered collection
* bag--unordered collection
* set--unordered and unique valued collection

[NOTE]
====
A collection such as a list could be restricted to unique values by using the keyword UNIQUE. For example, the EXPRESS expression LIST [3:?] OF UNIQUE IfcCartesianPoint; means a list of unique Cartesian points. 
====

PIComposer has a simplified collection data model where aggregation data types are modeled as vectors of defined types. PIComposer also supports multi-dimensional aggregation.

PIComposer users use the following commands to work with collections:

* add--add an instance
* add many--add multiple instances
* add reference--available for entity container only
* clear list--empty the collection

[WARNING]
====
When dealing with aggregation types, it is up to the user to manage the attributes' constraints, including uniqueness.
====

In PIComposer, a collection attribute has its own grouping node where collection commands are anchored.

.Entity collect commands
image::model-collection-attribute.png[]

Each add command activates a dialog box. To add mulitple instances into a collection, right click on the collection, and select the image:model-collection-attribute-add-many-command.png[] add many command.
.Entity collection, add many
image::model-collection-attribute-add-many.png[]

Complete the add many command by choosing the desired type and entering instance count.

=== Working with Propertyset, QuantitySet and Their Templates

Propertyset and quantityset are packaged in a IfcRelDefinesProperties component.  The preferred way to work with IfcRelDefinesProperties is using the following command on the root detail node:

* add propertyset--image:model-add-properties-command.png[] add propertyset command
* add selected propertyset--image:model-add-selected-propertyset.png[] add selected propertyset.
* add propertyset to selected--image:model-add-propertyset-to-selected.png[] add propertyset to selected instance (from instance filter).

Excecuting the image:model-add-properties-command.png[] add propertyset command activates the create propertyset dialog. Choose the desired propertyset or quantityset and click OK to complete propertyset creation.

.Create Property dialog
image::model-add-propertyset-dialog.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The dropdown in the above dialog lists all property sets and quantity sets known to PIComposer, including those defined in the standard schema as well as those defined by templates.
====

Ifc4x3 documentation defines a large number (more than 600) of property sets and quantity sets outside of the published schema. PIComposer needs to know their content in order to instantiate them. To configure PIComposer to create these and other user-defined property sets, PIComposer uses templates.

A template is defined using a JSON file.

==== Propertset Template
A property set is a collection of properties. Each property is an entity type that may have multiple attributes. Let's dive into the property set template by looking at an abridged example:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "__schema": "ifc4x3",
    "__type": "Pset_SlabCommon",
    "Reference" : {
        "property_type" : "P_SINGLEVALUE",
        "value_type" : "IfcIdentifier"
    },
    "Status" : {
        "property_type" : "P_ENUMERATEDVALUE",
        "value_type": "PEnum_ElementStatus"
    },
	"AcousticRating" : {
        "property_type" : "P_SINGLEVALUE",
        "value_type": "IfcLabel"
    },
	"PitchAngle" : {
        "property_type" : "P_SINGLEVALUE",
        "value_type": "IfcPlaneAngleMeasure"
    },
}
----

The first two template json properties provide header information:

* __schema--it must be ifc4x3
* __type--the propertyset type, it must be prefix with Pset_xxx

The remaining properties are property definition for the prepertyset. 

Each property has a name, a property_type, and a value_type.  In the example above for the first property we have:
 
 * name--Reference
 * property_type--P_SINGLEVALUE
 * value_type--IfcIdentifier
 
name is the name of the proerpty.  
 
The value of property_type comes for the standard enum IfcSimplePropertyTemplateTypeEnum.  The possible property_type values and their corresponding IfcProperty are:
 
 * P_SINGLEVALUE--IfcPropertySingleValue
 * P_ENUMERATEDVALUE--IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue
 * P_BOUNDEDVALUE--IfcPropertyBoundedValue
 * P_LISTVALUE--IfcPropertyListValue
 * P_TABLEVALUE--IfcPropertyListValue
 * P_REFERENCEVALUE--IfcPropertyListValue

Every value_type is a ifc defined type.

[NOTE]
====
propertyset templates are stored in the folder icon:folder[]/picomposer_data/propertyset_template
====

[TIP]
====
To create user-defined property sets at runtime without using templates, use the "Add Property Set" command to create an IfcPropertySet, and then add any desired IfcProperty to the model.
====

==== Quantityset Template
A quantityset is a collection of quantity.  A quantity is a subtype of IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity that has a numeric attribute. Like other templates, quantityset template specification are json files.  Below is a full example:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "__schema": "ifc4x3",
    "__type": "Qto_BeamBaseQuantities",
    "Length":  "Q_LENGTH",
    "CrossSectionArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"OuterSurfaceArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"GrossSurfaceArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"NetSurfaceArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"GrossVolume" : "Q_VOLUME",
	"NetVolume" : "Q_VOLUME",
	"GrossWeight" : "Q_WEIGHT",
	"NetWeight" : "Q_WEIGHT"
}
----
In the json file, first comes the header, which include the properties:

* __schema--must be ifc4x3
* __type--the quantityset name, must be prefixed with Qto_

The remaining json properties are a list of quantities which
has name and type. The possible types and their corresponding entity type are:

* Q_LENGTH--IfcQuantityLength
* Q_AREA--IfcQuantityArea
* Q_VOLUME--IfcQuantityVolume
* Q_COUNT--IfcQuantityCount
* Q_WEIGHT--IfcQuantityWeight
* Q_TIME--IfcQuantityTime

[NOTE]
====
Quantityset templates are stored in the folder icon:folder[]/picomposer_data/quantityset_template
====

[TIP]
====
To create user defined quantitysets at runtime without using templates, use the add propertyset command to create IfcElementQuantity and manually add any  IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity subtype. 
====

=== Working with layers
Layers are commonly used in CAD systems for grouping instances and controlling their visibility. In the IFC standard, the corresponding concept is embodied in the IfcPresentationLayerAssignment entity.

[NOTE]
====
Only component of type IfcShapeRepresentation can be assigned to a layer in PIComposer. However, instances could be filtered by layer indirectly by its association to a shape, see <<Layer Filter>>
====

To setup a layer, first create a IfcPresentationLayerAssignment instance using the instance filter create command.

.create command
image::model-instance-filter-create-command.png[]

To add layers to an IfcShapeRepresentation component, use the 
image:model-add-to-layer-command.png[] add to layer command.  

.add layer dialog
image::model-add-to-layer-dialog.png

In the add layer dialog, select the desired layer from the dropdown list.

==== Layer Filter
A layer provides a grouping of IfcShapeRepresentation components. A layer filter allows for quick access to this grouping. Optionally, instead of listing the shape components, users may choose to list the instances associated with the grouped shapes.

.layer filter
image::model-layer-filter.png[]

To use the layer filter, select the layer from the dropdown list,
and press the image:model-filter-by-layer-command.png[] filter by layer command.

[TIP]
====
The filtered result type is controlled by preference.
====

[TIP]
====
PIComposer does not show the layer filter if the model does not has any IfcPresentationLayerAssignment instance.

=== Ifc Exporting and 3d Viewer
To export models to ifc, click the image:navigationbar-export-model-button.png[] button on the navigation bar.  The exported model is saved to user's download folder with the the file name "modelId.ifc".

To view a model in 3d view, click show the show 3d image:navigationbar-show3d-button.png[] button on the navigation bar. This will kick start the export of the model to part21.  When the export is completed, the web 3d viewer will be launched.

[NOTE]
====
Both commands--export and view model--are background tasks. User may continue working in parallel while the command is running.
