== PIComposer BIM Model and Entity Instance

A PIComposer model is a collection of entity instances. Some these instance could be a collection of related instances; a mini model in and of itself with a implicit context.  Each BIM model has its own database.  Each instance is persisted as a document.

For each model, logically, PIComposer emphasizes two essential organizational concepts:

* spatial structure
* object placement.

The spatial structure enrichs a BIM model with a logical origanizational structure, while object placement defines the physical location of a instance within the model.  Each of these concepts are presented as trees in PIComposer.  

These two trees are managed in parallel; a node created in the spatial tree will trigger a correponding creation of a node in the placement tree.  

The placement tree structure is immutable.

[NOTE]
====
Placement tree display could be turned of by preference
====

Each instance in the model is visualized as a tree (an acyclic graph actually)--the instance detail tree--where a tree node is either a logical grouping node or an attriubted node of the instance. All instances attribute addition, modification and deletion are managed using the instance detail tree. 

Many instance's component could be displayed on the instance detail tree, including:

. propertyset/quantityset
. object placement
. placement absolute coordinate
. typeproduct
. shapes

[TIP]
====
Each component type display in the detail tree could be turned on/off using user preference.
====

PIComposer Community Edition is a single document application. To load a model, select a model in the Project pane model listing and click the image:navigationbar-model-button.png[] model button or simply double click on the item on the model list.

[NOTE]
====
User could return to the last active model by clicking the image:navigationbar-model-button.png[] model button from any other page of PIComposer.
====

PIComposer splits model presentation into two areas:

* the model structure
* model instance detail

The model structure area comprises of three tabs

* spatial--displays the logical spatial tree
* placement--displays the phyical placement tree
* filters--random instance access using filter and searches, also free form instance creation


=== Selection Set

Selection set is an essential component of the PIComposer user interface. Each of three model structure tabs have a selection set. Many commands make use of a selection set.  The selection set allows a user to create inter-node links, to insert template into the spatial tree, to insert selected nodes into other nodes, and enabling many other actions. 


=== Working with the Spatial Tree

The spatial tree is where the spatial structure is managed. The commands to manipulate the tree are directly available on the tree node as popup menu items.  To see the context sensitive commands on a tree node, right click on it.

.typical spatial command
image::model-spatial-node-command.png[]

[NOTE]
====
All tree commands are context sensitive, i.e. Their availability and action depends on the node type and the content of the node.
====

The commands available to the spatial tree nodes are:

* add child--add a IfcSpatialStructural element or IfcProduct to the spatial structure.
* add template child--instantiate the selected IfcProduct template in the filter tab to the spatial structure. 
* delete child--delete the select node
* show propertyset--show the current node's propertyset/quantityset in the instance detail tab.
* show shape--show the IfcShapeRepresentation of the node
* show typed--show the IfcTypeProduct of the node in the detail tab.
* copy--copy the current to clipboard
* paste--paste the clipboard content as child.

[NOTE]
====
Only leaf node can be deleted, except nodes with child opening or fill.
====

==== Add Child

To add a child to the spatial tree, select the parent node, right click on it to activate the node menu, and select the image:model-add-child-menu-item.png[] add child menu item.  This command creates three sets of information:

* the IfcProduct instance
* the shape component and the material for the shape
* local object placement component

.product creation dialog.
image::model-add-product-dialog.png[]
The options on the product tab include:

. To specify the IfcProduct type, type it in the custom text box or select it from the dropdown.
. To specify the relation of the product to the parent object, select the IfcRelRelation type from the dropdown or leave it at auto to automatically select it.
. Tag the instance for search.

.prodcut creation dialog IfcProductRepresentation tab
image::model-add-product-shape-dialog.png[]
The shape tab adds a IfcShapeRepresentation to the product.  The options are:

. create shape via a template
. create 3 dimensional shape
. create 2 dimensional shape
. create 1 or 0 dimensional shape
. create IfcStyledItem for the shape

Fill in the necessary information on each tab and click OK when done.

[TIP]
====
If you wish to skip adding IfcShapeRepresentation, leave the type dropdown to 'null'.   
====

[NOTE]
====
If template is not used when creating IfcShapeRepresenation, only a skeleton of a IfcRepresentationItem is created.  Details must be fill out in the *Instance Detail Tree*.    
====

[NOTE]
====
Adding children using the spatial tree node menu always adds a corresponding placement node to the placement tree.  The child is placed relative the parent. 
====

[NOTE]
====
Adding a child also creates multiple inverse links in the database to manage the various relationships between the node in different trees.  To have the correct model content appear on the trees, it is best to use the available commands.
====

==== Add Template As Child

This command uses the filter selection set. To instantiate an IfcProduct template as a child of a spatial node, follow these steps:

. activate the template tab
. check the template radio button
. use the type or tag filter to find the desired template, see the section <<Working with Instance Template>>.
. select the template

To add a template as child to the spatial structure, select the parent node, right click on it to activate the node menu, and select the image:model-add-child-template-menu-item.png[] add child template menu item. Enter the necessary information in the template creation dialog if the template is interactive.

==== Other Spatial Tree Node Commands

The delete child command image:model-delete-child-menu-item.png[] deletes the selected node and the corresponding placement node in the placement.  If the inverse link count to the shared IfcShapeRepresentation is 0, the IfcShapeRepresentation will be deleted from the model.

The copy command image:model-copy-child-menu-item.png[] copies the node to clipboard.  Only leaf node can be copy.  

[TIP]
====
Copying exception: nodes that could be templates are copyable.  For exmple an IfcWall with openings and doors/windows are copyable although it has openings as children 
====

The paste command image:model-paste-child-menu-item.png[] pastes the content of the clip to the tree.

[TIP]
====
Unlike template packaging, which do not package IfcTypeProduct, IfcPropertyset components into the template, the copy/paste command copy does since we are pasting into same model context. 
====

The show type command image:model-goto-typeproduct-menu-item.png[] shows the IfcTypeProduct componet of an entity in the detail tree.  

[NOTE]
====
All the show xxx commands apply the instance id filter to the targeted component to show the component in the detail tree.
====

=== Working with the Placement Tree

To underline its importance in the BIM model, the user interface includes a placement tree. 

To access the placement tree, activate the placement tab.

.The placement tree
image::model-placement-tab.png[]

The placement tree is immutable, its structure is created during the creation of the spatial tree.  When the spatial node corresponds to the placement is deleted, the placement will be automatically deleted.

The only command available to the placement tree is image:model-add-goto-placed-instance-menu-item.png[] which navigates to the IfcLocalPacement's placed instance.

The placement tree is immutable but the placement node is mutable.  Like all instance, its attribute are modified using the instance detail tree.

[NOTE]
====
The show placed instance command uses an inverse link to find the placed instance.
====

[TIP]
====
The placement tree can be hidden/shown by setting the hide flag in user preference.
====

=== Working with Filters

Filters allows a user to search and retrieve an item in the model or project quickly.  The filter tab also provides the workbench for dealing with free form instance and a place to work with instances outside of the spatial structure framework. There are two types of filters in the model pane: instance and template. 

For details about template filters see the section <<Working with Instance Template>>. We will concentrate on instance filter below.

.Instance Filter
image::model-instance-filter.png[]

==== Instance Type Filter

The basic functionality of the instance type filter is similar to template <<Type Filter>>. Instance filter has two addition features:

* filter by subtypes
* create entity instance of the filter type

The subtype filter functions same way the type filter does except that it consider all subtypes of the user specified type.

[TIP]
====
The user input type could be abstract for the subtype filter.
====

[NOTE]
====
Instance type filter is limited to return 1000 result instances.
====

==== Instance Creation  

To create instance of the desired type, select the type from the dropdown list and click the create image:model-instance-filter-add-entity.png[] button.

[TIP]
====
To create an instance of type not on the dropdown list, enter the type using the 'custom type' text box.  The type user wants to create must not be abstract.

.type filter dropdown
image::instance_type_filter_create.png[]
====

[WARNING]
====
Instance created using the create command here will not create any inverse links like it does using the spatial tree commands.  User is responsible for managing instance life cycle.
====


[NOTE]
====
The instance tag filter functions exactly like the tempate tag filter, see <<Tag Filter>>.
====

==== Instance Id Filter
Instance type filter is based on a list of specific instance id laterals and a list of ranges.  

.Instance id Filter
image::model-instance-filter-instance-id-example.png[]

To use the id filter, first enter the search string in the instance id text box.  The syntax is a comma separated list of positive integers and a list of integer ranges. A range is a pair of positive integer separated by a dash.  

In the example above, we are looking in the ranges 90 to 100, 200 to 210 and the instance ids 2, 45, 10 and 15.

Next click image:model-instance-filter-instance-id.png[] the instance id filter button.

[NOTE]
====
Each range is limited to 1000.
====

=== Working with Instance Detail Tree

The STEP ISO-10303 standard is a group of standards including an object model specification using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EXPRESS_(data_modeling_language)[EXPRESS language].  

An abstract object is a collection of attributes.  In PIComposer, an object is referred to as an instance--an instantiation of an entity type. 

==== Instance Detail Tree

According to ISO-10303-11: "EXPRESS data types are classified according to their nature as: simple data types, aggregation data types, constructed data types, named data types, and generalized data types."

The instance detail tree is where PIComposer users interact with instance and its attributes--"entity data type".

.Instance detail tree
image::model-instance-detail.png[]

The instance detail tree is a federated view .  It display the instance plus its components. The components are optional and their visibility is controlled by preference. The optional nodes include:

* placement
** absolute coordinates
* type--IfcTypeProduct
* propertyset/quantityset
* shape--IfcShapeRepresentation

[TIP]
====
The image:model-instance-show-detail-topple.png[] show optional attribute toggle hides optional attribute of an instance. This filter is also part of user preference
====

Like the spatial tree, user modify tree content by operating directly on the tree nodes.  

==== Instance Root Node

Operations that directly affect the basic structure of the node or entity's component are anchored at the root node.  The operations on the root node include:

* show 3d--show the instance in 3d. Available if a instance has shape  
* add to layer--add instance to a layer, available if there is layer in the model and the instance is of type IfcShapeRepresentation
* clear layer--remove instance from all layer it is assigned to
* create template--create a private template from the instance.  
* add shape--add a IfcShapeRepresentation component to instance
* clear shape--remove all shape.  Also, if the reference count of any shape reach zero, it will be removed from model
* Add RepItem--add a IfcRepresenationItem to a IfcShapeRepresentation component.
* add shape to selected--add selected IfcShapeRepresentation instance to the spatial tree selected node. 
* add type to selected--add IfcTypeProduct subtype to the selected spatial tree node. The current instance is the selected IfcRelDefinedByType component in the instance filter.
* add type--add IfcTyedProduct to instance
* remove type--remove instance from IfcRelDefinedByType component
* add pset--add IfcRelDefinedByProperties to instance
* clear pset--remove all IfcRelDefinedByProperties from instance
* add pset to selected--add filter selected IfcRelDefinedByProperties component to the spatial selected node.
* add template shape to selected--add template shape to the spatial selected node.
* delete--remove the instance

.Typical IfcProduct root node menu items
image::model-instance-detail-root-node-commands.png[]

==== Working with Attributes

An instance is a collection of attributes.  Each attribute has a data type. The basic attribute data types are:

* number
* real
* integer
* string
* boolean
* logical
* binary
* aggregation--collection
* defined type
* entity
* enum
* select

[TIP]
====
Each attribute node tooltip shows its respective data type.
====

[TIP]
====
Defined type is an alias for some already existed underline type.  For example IfcLogical is a LOGICAL type.
====

PIComposer divides attributes into two groups:

* simple--single value, requires only single node for user inter-action
* complex--multiple value, need a subtree to store its values

==== Simple Attributes
The simple type include:

* number
* real
* integer
* string
* boolean
* logical
* binary
* defined type, with simple underlining type
* enum

Numeric types, string and binary are stored in a text box.  Boolean, logical, and enums are presented in a dropdown list. In all cases, user interaction is straight forward.

.typcal attribute node command
image::model-simple-attribute-commands.png[]

[TIP]
====
When an attribute has been modified, there are two ways to commit updates to data store.  Right click on the label of the attribute to access the tree node menu and select the save menu item.
====

[TIP]
====
The save button on the right upper corner is a batch save button.  It commits all changes to the data store all at once.
====

The defined type IfcGloballyUniqueId has string as its underlining type.  Since the user might not have access to a UUID generator, PIComposer provides the set guid command. To set a guid attribute, right click on the label of the attribute and select the image:model-instance-detail-set-guid.png[] set guid command. 

==== Complex Attributes
The complex attribute types are:

* entity  
* select
* collection

A complex attribute usually requires multiple nodes to present its value.  In particular an entity instance, when composed in situ, will occupy a full substree.

Attribute node commands include:

* create--create an entity instance in place
* set reference--set attribute value as entity instance reference
* set reference selected--set spatial tree entity instance attriubte value to reference the selected instance in instance filter. 
* remove--remove instance or instance reference from a instance collection attribute
* show instance--show attribute instance in detail using instance filter.
* nullify--set optional attriubte to null

.typical entity attribute command
image::model-instance-detail-entity-attribute-commands.png[]

Just as there are two ways--link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20object%20composition,and%20aggregation%20is%20often%20ignored.[aggregation and composition]--to associate one object to another, there are two ways to associate an entity attribute to an entity instance.

==== A Brief Introduction to Object modeling
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, a PIComposer model is a collection of objects.  This section introduces some object concepts useful in the use of PIComposer.

.According to ChatGTP of OpenAI:
====
Objects and Object Association

In object-oriented programming, *objects* are the fundamental building blocks that represent entities in the real world or abstract concepts. They are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. *Object association* is the concept of connecting objects together to represent relationships between them. 

Object association can be implemented using two approaches: composition and aggregation. Both approaches are used to represent different types of relationships between objects.

Object Composition

Object composition is a form of object association where one object contains another object as a part of its state. The contained object cannot exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is tied to the container object. This is known as a "has-a" relationship.

For example, a car object may contain an engine object. The engine is a part of the car and cannot exist without it. The car object controls the lifecycle of the engine object, and the engine object cannot exist outside of the car object.

Object Aggregation

Object aggregation is a form of object association where one object uses another object as a part of its functionality. The contained object can exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is not tied to the container object. This is known as a "uses-a" relationship.

For example, a car object may use a navigation system object to provide directions to the driver. The navigation system is not a part of the car, and it can exist independently of the car object. The car object does not control the lifecycle of the navigation system object, and the navigation system object can exist outside of the car object.

Difference between Object Composition and Object Aggregation

The key difference between object composition and object aggregation is the lifecycle of the contained object. In object composition, the contained object cannot exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is tied to the container object. In object aggregation, the contained object can exist independently of the container object, and its lifecycle is not tied to the container object.

Another difference is the relationship between the container object and the contained object. In object composition, the contained object is a part of the container object, and it is owned by the container object. In object aggregation, the contained object is used by the container object, and it is not owned by the container object.

Conclusion

Object association is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming that allows developers to model relationships between objects. Object composition and object aggregation are two approaches used to represent different types of relationships between objects. It is important to understand the difference between these two approaches to choose the appropriate approach for a given situation.
====

==== Object Aggregation and Composition in PIComposer

Aggregation is the default instance to instance association in STEP standard, in fact, it is the only option in ISO 10303 part21 standard.  The most important difference between object composition and aggregation is that aggregated object is potentially shared among many objects and composed object is embeded in a single parent object.

.Anatomy of Aggregation and Composer
image::model-object-aggregation-composition.png[]
In the figure above:

. the composite node groups all the shared children within a container object to be referenced.
. The IfcCartesianPoint object is an aggregated object referenced by 7 inside the composed IfcPolyloop object.
. The composed IfcClosedShell inside a IfcFacetedBrep object
. The cfsfaces attribute of the IfcClosedShell object, here it contains a composed collection of IfcFaces.
. Composed IfcFaces
. The polygon attribute of IfcPolyloop, it comprises of a collection of aggregated IfcCartesianPoint.
. An aggregate IfcCartesianPoint.
. The contextofitems attribute of an IfcShapeRepresentation object.  It references a IfcGeometricRepresentationContext object in the model.

[NOTE]
====
* To share an object with in a model, create it in the model using the filter panel and share it by aggregation.
* To share an object with a container object, create it under the composites node and share it by aggregation.
* To compose an object, use a create/add object command and compose the object in situ.  For detail see below.
* Prefer composition over aggregation, whenever possible.
* To share across model boundary, create a template.
====

One way to create an aggregation is use the *reference selected instance* command.
To use the *reference selected instance* command, follow the steps below:

. select the desired reference target in instance filter
. right click on the entity attribute node label to activate popup menu
. choose image:model-set-reference-selected-command.png[] set reference selected menu item

[TIP]
====
Reference selected command will only be available if the selected instance is compatible to the Entity attribute. If attribute is optional, it must be null. To reset to a different reference, nullify first
====

To set reference without using instance filter, select the image:model-set-reference-command.png[] set reference menu item and enter the target instance id on the dialog.

.set reference
image::model-set-reference-dialog.png[]

For a component, as a rule for non-shared attribute instance, the create command is the prefered method when populating entity attribute values. In the case of shared instance in a component, use the add composite command to create the shared instance, see <<Component and Composite>>.

To create attribute instance in place, right click on the attribute label, then select image:model-instance-detail-create-attribute-instance-command.png[] command.  If necessary fill in the detail in object creation dialog.

[NOTE]
====
If the type to create has no subtype, attribute instance is directly created; no input from user is solicited. 
====

==== Working With Select

A select entity attribute is a single value polymorphic container; it could hold value of any defined type within its specification.  

There are three commands for select attributes:

* nullify--set optional select attribute to null value
* create--create the select object in place.
* remove--remove select from a collection of select

.select attriubte menu
image::model-select-attribute-menu.png[]

The PIComposer create select user interface is based on two key concepts:

* the selected type
* the value of the selected type

To create a select attribute value, select the image:model-create-select-attribute-menu-item.png[] create select menu item.  Fill in the detail in the create select dialog by first specifying the selected type, then value type.

.example of select of a select attribute
image::model-select-create-dialog.png[]

==== Working with Collection

STEP aggregation data types are collections of defined types. Aggregations could contain order or unordered, unique or none-unique values.  Aggregation containers include:

* array--indexed ordered collection
* list--ordered collection
* bag--unordered collection
* set--unordered and unique valued collection

[NOTE]
====
A collection such as a list could be restricted to contain uniuqe values by using the key word UNIQUE. For example, the EXPRESS expression LIST [3:?] OF UNIQUE IfcCartesianPoint; means list of unique catesian points.
====

PIComposer has a simplified collection data model; PIComposer models aggregation data types as vector of defined types.  PIComposer supports multi-dimension aggregation. 

PIComposer users use the following commands to work with collections:

* add--add an instance
* add many--add multiple instances
* add reference--available for entity container only
* clear list--empty the collection

In PIComposer, a collect attribute has its own grouping node where collection commands are anchored.

.Entity collect commands
image::model-collection-attribute.png[]

Each add command activates a dialog box. To add mulitple instances into a collection, right click on the collection, and select the image:model-collection-attribute-add-many-command.png[] add many command.
.Entity collection, add many
image::model-collection-attribute-add-many.png[]

Complete the add many command by choosing the desired and entering instance count.

=== Working with Propertyset, QuantitySet and Their Templates

Propertyset and quantityset are packaged in a IfcRelDefinesProperties component.  The preferred way to work with IfcRelDefinesProperties is using the following command on the root detail node:

* add propertyset--image:model-add-properties-command.png[] add propertyset command
* add selected propertyset--image:model-add-selected-propertyset.png[] add selected propertyset.
* add propertyset to selected--image:model-add-propertyset-to-selected.png[] add propertyset to selected instance (from instance filter).

Excecuting the image:model-add-properties-command.png[] add propertyset command activates the create propertyset dialog. Choose the desired propertyset or quantityset and click OK to complete propertyset creation.

.Create Property dialog
image::model-add-propertyset-dialog.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The dropdown in the above dialog lists all propertyset and quantityset known to PIComposer which including those defined in the standard and those by templates. 
====

Ifc4x3 documentation defines a large number (more than 600) of propertyset and quantityset outside of the schema.  PIComposer must know their content in order to instantiate them.  To configure PIComposer to create these and other user defined propertyset, PIComposer uses template.  

A template is defined using json file.

==== Propertset Template
A propertyset is a collection of properties.  Each property is an entity type. A property might have multiple attributes.  We dive into propertyset templatse by looking at an abrigded example: 

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "__schema": "ifc4x3",
    "__type": "Pset_SlabCommon",
    "Reference" : {
        "property_type" : "P_SINGLEVALUE",
        "value_type" : "IfcIdentifier"
    },
    "Status" : {
        "property_type" : "P_ENUMERATEDVALUE",
        "value_type": "PEnum_ElementStatus"
    },
	"AcousticRating" : {
        "property_type" : "P_SINGLEVALUE",
        "value_type": "IfcLabel"
    },
	"PitchAngle" : {
        "property_type" : "P_SINGLEVALUE",
        "value_type": "IfcPlaneAngleMeasure"
    },
}
----

The first template two json properties are the headers:

* __schema--it must be ifc4x3
* __type--the propertyset type, it must be prefix with Pset_xxx

The remaining properties are property definition for the prepertyset. 

Each property has a name, a property_type, and value_type.  In the example above for the first property we have:
 
 * name--Reference
 * property_type--P_SINGLEVALUE
 * value_type--IfcIdentifier
 
name is the name of the proerpty.  
 
The value of property_type comes for the standard enum IfcSimplePropertyTemplateTypeEnum.  The possible property_type values and their corresponding IfcProperty are:
 
 * P_SINGLEVALUE--IfcPropertySingleValue
 * P_ENUMERATEDVALUE--IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue
 * P_BOUNDEDVALUE--IfcPropertyBoundedValue
 * P_LISTVALUE--IfcPropertyListValue
 * P_TABLEVALUE--IfcPropertyListValue
 * P_REFERENCEVALUE--IfcPropertyListValue

Every value_type is a ifc defined type.

[NOTE]
====
propertyset templates are stored in the folder icon:folder[]/picomposer_data/propertyset_template
====

[TIP]
====
To create user defined propertyset at runtime without using templates, use the add propretyset command to create IfcPropertyset then add any IfcProperty. 
====

==== Quantityset Template
A quantityset is a collection of quantity.  A quantity is a subtype of IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity that has a numeric attribute. Like other templates, quantityset template specification are json files.  Below is a full example:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "__schema": "ifc4x3",
    "__type": "Qto_BeamBaseQuantities",
    "Length":  "Q_LENGTH",
    "CrossSectionArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"OuterSurfaceArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"GrossSurfaceArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"NetSurfaceArea":  "Q_AREA",
	"GrossVolume" : "Q_VOLUME",
	"NetVolume" : "Q_VOLUME",
	"GrossWeight" : "Q_WEIGHT",
	"NetWeight" : "Q_WEIGHT"
}
----
In the json file, first comes the header, which include the properties:

* __schema--must be ifc4x3
* __type--the quantityset name, must be prefixed with Qto_

The remaining json properties are a list of quantities which
has name and type. The possible types and their corresponding entity type are:

* Q_LENGTH--IfcQuantityLength
* Q_AREA--IfcQuantityArea
* Q_VOLUME--IfcQuantityVolume
* Q_COUNT--IfcQuantityCount
* Q_WEIGHT--IfcQuantityWeight
* Q_TIME--IfcQuantityTime

[NOTE]
====
Quantityset templates are stored in the folder icon:folder[]/picomposer_data/quantityset_template
====

[TIP]
====
To create user defined quantitysets at runtime without using templates, use the add propertyset command to create IfcElementQuantity and manually add any  IfcPhysicalSimpleQuantity subtype. 
====

=== Working with layers
Layers are commonly used in CAD system for instance grouping and visibility control.  The corresponding concept in ifc are embodied in the IfcPresentationLayerAssignment entity.

[NOTE]
====
Only component of type IfcShapeRepresentation can be assigned to a layer in PIComposer. However, instances could be filtered by layer indirectly by its association to a shape, see <<Layer Filter>>
====

To setup a layer, first create a IfcPresentationLayerAssignment instance using the instance filter create command.

.create command
image::model-instance-filter-create-command.png[]

To add layers to an IfcShapeRepresentation component, use the 
image:model-add-to-layer-command.png[] add to layer command.  

.add layer dialog
image::model-add-to-layer-dialog.png

In the add layer dialog, select the desired layer from the dropdown list.

==== Layer Filter
A layer providing grouping of IfcShapeRepresentation component.  A layer filter provides quick access to this grouping quickly.  Optionally, instead of shape components, users may list the instances that are associated to the grouped shapes.

.layer filter
image::model-layer-filter.png[]

To use the layer filter, select the layer from the dropdown list,
and press the image:model-filter-by-layer-command.png[] filter by layer command.

[TIP]
====
The filtered result type is controlled by preference.
====

[TIP]
====
PIComposer does not show the layer filter if the model does not has any IfcPresentationLayerAssignment instance.
====

=== Ifc Exporting and 3d Viewer
To export models to ifc, click the image:navigationbar-export-model-button.png[] export model ifc model on the navigation bar.

To view a model in 3d view, click show the image:navigationbar-show3d-button.png[] 3d button on the navigation bar. This will kick start the export of the model to part21.  When the export is completed, the web 3d viewer will be launched.

[NOTE]
====
Both commands are background tasks. User may continue working in parallel while the command is running. 
====
