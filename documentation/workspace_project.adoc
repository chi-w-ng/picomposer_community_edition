== Workspace and Projects

PIComposer is a multi-user system where each user has their own distinct workspace for organizing projects.

A project is a collection of IFC models and other related documents.

After successful authentication, a user is initially directed to the workspace pane.

There are three main user interface components:

* The project list--list of user's project.
* The navigation bar--list of commands to access various part of PIComposer.
* The status bar--status of active command (progress, success or failure indicators).

=== Add and Removing a Project

To add a project, click the add button image:navigationbar-add-button.png[].

To remove a project, select it on the project list, click the minus button image:navigationbar-minus-button.png[].

=== Navagation

****
TIP: Most PIComposer commands are context dependant.  The add and minus button, for example, would add or remove a project in a workspace but add and remove a model in the project pane.

The workspace button image:navigationbar-workspace-button.png[] is the home button.  It routes to the workspace pane from anywhere in PIComposer.  

The project button image:navigationbar-project-button.png[] activates the project pane and displays the contents of selected project or the most recently displayed project.

****
TIP: Double clicking on any project on the project list also activates the project pane and displays the project content.

The model button image:navigationbar-model-button.png[] activates the model pane and displays the last active model content.  See the <<PIComposer BIM models>> section for more detail about how to work with BIM models.

The preference button image:navigationbar-setting-button.png[] activates the preference page.  See the <<Preferenes>> section for more detail.

The account button image:navigationbar-account-button.png[] activates the account page.  See the <<User Account>> section for more detail.

The help button image:navigationbar-help-button.png[] activates the help popup menu which has two commands image:navigationbar-help-menu.png[140,140]:

* documentation--show PIComposer documentation in a browser
* about--show PIComposer license information

PIComposer provides user feedback using the status bar. Depending on the nature of the command, the status shows:

* A progress bar for long running command
* Notification of successful completion of a command
* Error message for failed command

Each type of status can be turned on and off using preferences.
