== Workspace and Projects

PIComposer is a multi-user system.  Each login user on a device has his or her own distinct workspace.  

In a PIComposer workspace, users organize their projects.  A project is collections of models and documents.

After sucessful authentication, a user is first routed to the workspace pane.

* The navigation bar
* The status bar

Projects are listed in the project list pane.
